There is much to be discovered about general interoperability on Ethereum or any other blockchain that supports a similar system of smart contracts.

Today, interoperable protocols are specialized to limited areas of interest, such as DeFi.

For more interesting patterns to emerge, we must have a more general view of decentralized systems.

One such pattern, we have found to be the Ethereum Deep Object Pattern. Data and Behavior is spread across multiple contracts and Each contract is responsible for a well-defined part of the object maintenance is decentralized (by contract) to multiple entities and interests. The Ethereum Deep Object is fully typed and with deterministic behavior. It is fully transparent and traversable. And it can be decoded and hydrated/enriched off-chain. It is semantically connected with other deep objects.

Usecases include, but are not limited to the popularized patterns of: wallets, profiles, NFT collections, semantic graphs.

This is a visual representation of a Deep Object, with objects that reference one another, to create complex data records, they can share type-specific behavior. And are retrievable to the user as a deep object.

This technology was created by and for volunteers at The Laurel Project. You may join this tech effort.
