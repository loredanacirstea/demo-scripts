# The Ultimate Web3 IDE - Advanced dApp Tools - User Manual, Logging

If you want to know why Marks Factory is the ultimate web3 IDE, check out my other videos. There are tens of video examples of dApps, debuggers, and IDEs that I built with Marks Factory. I am building The Laurel with Marks Factory and I am building Marks Factory with Marks Factory.

And the time has come to focus on better developer tools and user tools, for the users with a more inquisitive nature.

In the editing mode, when writing a decentralized application in our Taylor-powered Markdown language, you can open the tools menu and see the table of contents and the user manual. And you can quickly navigate in a long application.

You can open the user manual in edit mode. And continue writing an awesome manual for your dApp users.

Let's see how this manual looks for your users. In preview mode, this is the table of contents. But you can also open the manual as a full presentation.

You can open our internal developer tools, like our logger. And view the application logs, indexed with a tree of topics.

For example, if we select another task here, a log is added and indexed by timestamp and by the topics chosen by the dApp developer.

If we choose to view another option on the graph, we also get a log of this action. And when we are done with the app, we can have a log of all important actions that we took. 

And we can also analyze the full logged objects, and see the level, timestamp, topics, and logged variables.

You can open your dApp in our external developer tools, in another page, like with our EVM debugger or Jack the hijacker, that were presented in previous videos.

But I will show you more, in later videos.


The Marks Factory and all these tools are built by volunteers, for volunteers. You are welcome to join the revolution. Details in the description.
