# The Laurel Project - A Resolution for Freedom

https://youtu.be/nxgaziVZayY


Freedom and Agape are central to The Laurel Project philosophy.
A nation of the free, governed by one purpose: all effort must be made for the benefit of others, in unity, across generations.

In our society each person has a great personal debt. In our lifetime, none of us is able to repay what we have been given - from the food that we eat, to the tools that we use and to the joys that we have. All of these have been built and fought for, by others. From all times, we are the highest beneficiaries.

Each human has a duty to volunteer hard, serious effort for the benefit of society, at the expense of personal benefit. And everybody else has the duty to recognize and award this effort appropriately.

Intent matters. The new society can only be built from effort volunteered from the heart.
Join The Laurel Project only if you are ready to test and be tested by your peers on your intent and willingness to make effort for others.
