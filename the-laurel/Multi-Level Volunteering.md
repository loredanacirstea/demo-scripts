# Multi-Level Volunteering


"Din bube, mucegaiuri si noroi, iscat-am frumuseti si preturi noi."


Can we repurpose mechanisms that have traditionally been used to exploit human greed, to create a system that multiplies generosity?

The Laurel explores multi-level volunteering. How to incentivize volunteers to bring other volunteers into the system, teach and mentor them.

If we have a volunteer tree such as this one, where Alice is Bob's and Emma's ancestor in the system and Bob is Charlie's and Dan's ancestor, then whenever Dan gets awarded volunteer points from helping others, both Bob and Alice earn points too, because the system mints for them a percentage of what Dan received. So this multi-level marketing for volunteers is not like a Ponzi scheme, because new volunteers, like Dan, do not lose any laurels. But, it is more like gospel or evangelism where the information and laurels are propagated.

So, Dan receives his entire award. But his ancestors, Bob and Alice also benefit from his dedication. Anyone can join this system. And anyone who joins the system will register with an ancestor - a volunteer who is already registered in the system, from whom they found out about the Laurel, and who has every incentive to help you help others.

Dan has programmed a new feature for The Laurel, which allows all volunteers to better keep track of who needs help to navigate the system. Let's see what happens when Dan gets awarded laurels for his volunteer work.

The task initiator, Kali, has offered 10 coding laurels for this task. Dan himself has put the same amount of points in escrow, as a proof of trust, when he claimed the task. The rest of the 40 points are points offered by other volunteers who found Dan's feature so useful, that they were unable to not show their gratitude.

All 60 Coding Laurels go to Dan. But, they enter Dan's primordial balance. Which means that he cannot use them just yet. He needs to actively transfer them to his active balance. When he does this, the system calculates 10% of this amount and mints it for Dan's ancestor, Bob, into Bob's primordial balance, which is now 0. Dan does not lose anything, but Bob gains 10%. I am signed in as Dan, so letâ€™s activate the primordial balance. Now we have 100 coding laurels in the active balance. And Bob has 6 laurels in his primordial balance. Similarly, when Bob transfers his primordial laurels to an active balance, Alice will receive 10% of Bob's laurels. In this case, it would be 0.6, so Bob will wait until he accumulates more.
If Dan makes mistakes and the system punishes him for making a false claim, Alice and Bob are safe from punishment.

So, Alice and Bob are rewarded for bringing new volunteers into the system and their generosity is multiplied. 

The Laurel is in prototype phase. But if you want to try the system already and gain laurels early, go to the form in the description and subscribe. And we will send you an invitation to our first alpha version.
