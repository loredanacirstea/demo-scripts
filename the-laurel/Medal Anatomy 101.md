# Medal Anatomy 101

Let us direct together, a medal such as this one.

A medal is always available, always challengeable, revertable, evidence-based, traceable, verifiable, provable, qualifiable, and quantifiable.

A medal is presentable, printable, mobile-ready (phones & tablets), intuitive: medal-like geometry, exportable

A medal contains a QRcode to verify the validity of the medal, qualitative and quantitative qualifiers for the effort, and an intuitive transformation into time spent by the medal earner. Attribution to the personâ€™s unique identifier and profile picture.

This is an example of a medal, with QRcode, profile information, and qualifiers.

A medal needs tools to create and verify it.
Activity charts for members. And a decentralized application, that everyone can contribute to and use in perpetuity. 

The hardest attributes of a medal. It is decentralized and backed by a blockchain, permissionless, through rules defined in a smart contract. It is scalable, layer 2 ready and the decentralized app is available on IPFS.

A project that implements such medals is The Laurel and already usable now.
