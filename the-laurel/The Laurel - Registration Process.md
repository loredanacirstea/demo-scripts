## The Laurel - Registration Process


The Laurel has a first release, on the Ropsten Ethereum network. You are able to earn several kinds of laurels, spend laurels, do continuous voting on volunteering reward claims. You can earn laurels from the volunteers you bring in the system. You can earn arbitration laurels, when you vote and organize events.

Today you will see the current registration process for joining The Laurel as a volunteer.

In the video description you will find the link to a short form, with email registration. After filling in the form, we will send an email, inviting you to our Discord chat, the volunteersâ€™ repository and to The Laurel decentralize app.

Once there, you will register as a volunteer, on the Ethereum network. First, get an Ethereum address and some Ropsten ETH from the faucet.

And then, fill in your Ethereum address here and the Ethereum account of your ancestor. You ancestor is the person who invited you into the system, who told you about the Laurel.

You can only choose your ancestor from the list of registered volunteers.

And then, you will be able to claim volunteer effort, receive laurels and vote.

And more will come.
