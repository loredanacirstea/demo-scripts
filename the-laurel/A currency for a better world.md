# A currency for a better world

A society of idealists deserves a new type of carriers of value, with new rules.
Generosity has to become trustless and computable. So humans can base their ideals upon it. Otherwise: how can you prove that an ideal higher than generosity exists if generosity cannot be proven?

Volunteers deserve to be rewarded and honored according to their merit. But volunteers cannot be rewarded with money. Normal money is a measure of effort towards individual interests. Hence, using money corrupts the goals in a system of volunteers. If a volunteer would receive normal money, they would lose their volunteer status.

We had to invent the laurel in other to attest that any rewarded effort is for the benefit of others, not for self. Therefore, a volunteer who receives laurels, does not lose the quality of being a volunteer.


In the following series of videos, we will explore what it means to be generous - to be a volunteer. We will measure altruism and performance. The system will make it clear who are the beneficiaries of every action and who are the doers.

Unequal actions are rewarded with different types of laurels. We will make available a wide selection of dimensions for measuring effort.

Laurels are dynamic. If at any point in time you will be caught cheating, you will be punished. There will be no escape. Your peers can vote continuously on your volunteering claims. Similarly, if you voted incorrectly, you will be punished.

But, the rewards are multiplied by the system itself. Generosity is multiplicative. If you are generous and give your effort, you will be able to be even more generous with others, by using your points to coordinate volunteering tasks and rewarding and receiving rewards from your volunteers.



The laurels, hence the volunteering effort, are backed by on-chain proofs.
Volunteers are paid with Laurels by other volunteers.
Laurels are not tradeable with other currencies, they are always earned
Proofs remain challengeable on-chain as long as the Laurels are in use
The challenge mechanism is a continuous vote with specific parameters
Extensible to L2
The Laurels will forever prove the volunteering effort


I have been working on the first version of the Laurel Simulator, which will be used to set the game parameters.

Now, we can use any Github repository to set up and reference the volunteering tasks.

We can create new volunteering tasks from the issues.
Then, volunteers can claim the task by first auctioning the amount themselves.
So, Alice has claimed the reward. And 10 units from her Coding Laurels are put in escrow, along with the 10 units from the organizer.

Then, Bob can also vote to reward Alice, with 2 units of Coding Laurels.

So, other peers can vote for a volunteer claiming a reward, but the voted amount will be received by this volunteer as a reward. A volunteer can receive more laurels than the initial claim if they have done such a good job, that others want to reward him with all their heart.

Emma can claim that she is the one who solved the issue, so she opens another voting option, for her. Fall votes for her. Jim does too. And so on.
Hal votes that this is all a sham and that the work was never done. The graph has multiple dimensions and we can see Hal's vote by selecting option 1.
If you want to find out what happens with the rewards and who is penalized, wait for the next videos in the series.


As we saw in the demo:
We can use any GitHub repo for the initial setup. System actions will be backed by the chain and the Laurel will become a decentralized app, ready to be used by any volunteer organization.

The Laurel itself will be bootstrapped using itself.
Early minting of Laurels will soon be available. For volunteers.
